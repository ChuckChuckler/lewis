# Lewis Structures

## What is it?
A simple Lewis Structures practice website for my test on Monday.

## What does it do?
Simply click the practice button. The program will, after some math and conditionals, auto-generate a molecule that has the possibility to exist-- that is, it is possible to model it using a lewis structure-- using a list of potential nonmetals. This molecule will have one central atom and either one or two species of terminal atoms. It may be neutral or an ion. There can be multiple of one terminal element; however, the number will never exceed six. From then on, the program will ask the user to input the number of bonding zones and lone pairs, the hybridization orbital, the molecular shape, the bond angles, and the molecule's overall polarity. The user must obtain this information by creating the necessary lewis structure and calculating the respective values. Once the user enters the values and clicks the "check" button, the program will inform the user whether or not they got everything correct, and if not, what they got incorrect and what the correct answer was. This can be repeated as many times as wished simply by clicking the "practice" button again.
